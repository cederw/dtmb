# Don't Yell At My Birdie

A clone of the "widely-popular" game [Don't Touch My Birdie](https://github.com/marksteve/dtmb) created using the [Phaser framework](http://phaser.io/) and the Web Speech API.

Now you can talk to bird. Beg it to jump.

It's pretty laggy due to how the API is implemented, make sure you speak clearly, and leave spaces between words.
